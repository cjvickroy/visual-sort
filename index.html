        <h2>About this tool</h2>
        <p>
          This web application is designed to help anyone interested in computer science to learn and understand common sorting algorithms that are used throughout the industry.
          <br><br>
          There are many sorting algorithms that can be applied to the same dataset. Use this tool to learn how.
          <br><br>
          Select a sort from the list to the right to begin using the tool.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>What are the differences between these sorting algorithms?</h3>
        <p>
          Each sorting algorithm has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Some are more efficient than others, and some are more useful than others.
          <br><br>
          The most important thing to remember is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to sorting data. Each algorithm has its own use case.
          <br><br>
          Use this tool to learn how each algorithm works, and when it is most useful.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>How do I use this tool?</h3>
        <p>
          The tool is designed to be as simple as possible. There are only a few controls to learn.
          <br><br>
          The controls are located on the left side of the screen. The controls are as follows:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Start - Starts the selected sorting algorithm</li>
            <li>Stop - Stops the sorting algorithm</li>
            <li>Reset - Resets the array to its original state</li>
            <li>Speed - Controls the speed of the sorting algorithm</li>
            <li>Number of Elements - Controls the number of elements in the array</li>
          </ul>
